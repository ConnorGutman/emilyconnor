    <h2>Hello! If you are reading this, chances are you saw our brick at Pioneer Square. This brick was purchased in
        February of 2021 to celebrate the third anniversary of Emily Arellano and Connor Gutman as a couple. Emily and I
        met at a coffee shop in Phoenix, Arizona while she was attending Arizona State. The two of us quickly fell in
        love and during the summer of 2019 took a trip down the west coast. We absolutely adored this city and decided
        to move to Portland, Oregon after graduating college. Unfortunately, that was in the middle of 2020!
        Nevertheless, our love has been much like this city: resilient. Neither pandemics nor wildfires nor tyrannical
        federal agents can stop what has been built here. Pioneer Square is where Portland gathers, and these bricks
        tell the stories of those who stand upon them. There are expressions of pain and heartbreak for our city's black
        lives. There are goodbyes for neighbors and loved ones lost to COVID-19. However, amid all of this pain, there
        remains so much love to be found in this beautiful square. Portland is where we rented our first home together.
        It's where you and I have walked for hours and discussed a million different subjects. The world, our fears, our
        future, our passions, our love, the small things, the big things, television recaps, dinner ideas, and how
        horrendously sweet Peet's coffee is. Even though these streets are empty and boarded up right now, they feel
        full of life when I stand here with you. It reminds me that happiness does not come from the state of the world,
        it comes from my proximity to you.<br><br>Thank You for three beautiful years. I love you Emily, and I cannot
        wait to walk the entire Earth with you.<br>-Connor</h2>
